                  <h3>Initial Ideas</h3>
                  <p>We were inspired by the potential of what the SenselMorph, a pressure sensor module, could do. With the SenselMorph we will be able to identify not only the physical shapes and surfaces of the objects that touch the sensor, but also the distribution of pressure.  With this idea in mind, we wanted to investigate how “identifiable” certain aspects of our body can be from others. The project was in part an exploration of machine learning, as well as what kind of new use cases we could project onto it.</p>

              <h3>Training</h3>
              <p>In order to train a robust neural net, we needed several hundreds of photos. However, since the event we are recording is fairly short, repeating the event over and over wasn’t too hard. To further expedite this process, we made it so that our script can automatically save images when it detects that the event has “ended”. Across four people, we gathered about 400 sample images, and after removing poor samples, we ended with about 300. In hindsight, we probably should have trained it on much more data samples, but for the purposes of the assignment, 300 was more than sufficient.</p>
              <p>With Pytorch, we were able to implement a convolutional neural network in Python and build a model using the 1200 train images that were collected. <a href="http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/">Here</a> is more theoretical and technical information on Convolutional Neural Networks.</p>

                <h3>Results</h3>
                  <p>When training a neural net, there is a concept called “epochs”, which is essentially how long we want to train the data for. If we overtrain the data, we suffer from something called over fitting, which is basically when the model is too hard coded on just recognizing the training data, and will fail to recognize any other external picture that isn’t identical to any of its training data. Therefore, to get the best results, we had to play around with how long we want to train the data. Overall, the results were around 85% –  90% accuracy, which is over our expectations.</p>

                <h3>Conclustion</h3>
                <p>Once we were able to classify hands/feet, we were able to confirm our hypothesis that every hand is unique and are identifiable just like fingerprint. As we worked on this project, we’ve realized that thsi could have many more applications than just classifying hand and feet. Some other use cases include: butt classification for sit-down establishments like restaurants and barber shops, front door mat classifiers to identify visitors, and so on. We are optimistic from how accurate our foot and hand classifications ended up, and we definitely plan on thinking of more use cases for it.</p>
